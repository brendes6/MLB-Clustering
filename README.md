# MLB Clustering Project

This project uses clustering techniques in order to group MLB Hitters by power vs contact hitters. They are clustered based on a "power_contact_ratio" data feature and labeled accordingly. The visualization created shows the proportion of hitters by decade that fall under the "contact" vs "power" category.
